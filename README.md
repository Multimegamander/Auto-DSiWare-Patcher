# Auto-DSiWare-Patcher
A Patcher to get DS/DSi games back online!

[Releases](https://github.com/ApfelTV/Auto-DSiWare-Patcher/releases/)

## Usage
1. Download the patcher and extract it into any folder that you want.
1. On Unix: Install [mono](http://www.mono-project.com) for your OS and Architecture.
1. Make sure you have a good dump of your game that supports Nintendo WFC and make sure its a nds or app file (if you have an srl: rename it to nds).
1. On Windows: use patcher.bat and do what it says. On Unix: use patcher.sh and do what it says.
1. In the directory of the patcher are several files now: One that is your unpatched rom and the another file has a (wiimmfi.de) in its name too. To use the patched files, use the files with a (wiimmfi.de) in their name.
1. For 3DS/DSi User: You can replace the unpatched app with the .app file that you have patched by overwriting the unpatched app by using GodMode9 for 3DS or HiyaCFW with SD NAND for DSi.
